# Dice Game ðŸŽ²ðŸš©
This GitHub repository contains a simple dice game that helps people decide who wins. The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The game randomly generates a number between 1 and 6 for each player, representing the face of a dice. It then displays the corresponding dice images for each player.

If player 1's number is greater than player 2's number, the game declares "Player 1 wins" with a flag emoji. If player 2's number is greater, it declares "Player 2 wins" with a flag emoji. If both players have the same number, it declares a "Match draw" with a crossed flags emoji.

The game interface is designed with a container that holds the dice and the result. Each player's dice is displayed with their corresponding number and an image of a dice face.

The repository includes the following files:

**index.html**: The HTML file that contains the game interface.

**styles.css:** The CSS file that provides styling for the game interface.

**index.js:** The JavaScript file that contains the game logic.

To play the game, simply open the index.html file in a web browser and refresh the page to generate a new result.
